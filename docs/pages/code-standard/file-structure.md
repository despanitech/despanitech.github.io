# File Structure

... main file structure

## General rules & conventions

- Files which includes `JSX` must have `.jsx` extension
- Directories always are `camelCase`
- Components, Screens and related files must be `PascalCase`
- Every file (including `utilities`, `constants`, `routs`, `assets` etc except files describe above) names always are `camelCase`
- Component/Class name and file name must be the same
- We have to avoid use of articles in naming (`makeReview` instead of `makeAReview`)
